  <h1>QR-Ixonity End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 12 October 2025</p>

  <p>This End-User License Agreement (“Agreement”, “EULA”) is a legally binding contract between you (an individual or a legal entity) and Sole Proprietor <strong>Oleksii Zaitsev</strong> (Ixonity) (“Licensor”, “we”, “us”) governing your use of the <strong>QR-Ixonity</strong> mobile application, related web services, server infrastructure, and associated materials (collectively, the “App” or the “Service”).
  <br><strong>This Agreement is concluded between you and the Licensor; Apple Inc. is not a party to this Agreement and is not responsible for the App or its content.</strong></p>

  <p>By installing, copying, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this EULA, our Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not install or use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
  <p><strong>1.1 Type of license.</strong> We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the App on devices you own or control, solely for lawful purposes and in accordance with this EULA, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p><strong>1.2 Restrictions.</strong> You shall not:
    <br>— modify, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the App, except as expressly permitted by applicable law;
    <br>— circumvent technical limitations or protections;
    <br>— rent, sell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer rights to the App to any third party;
    <br>— use the App in any manner that violates the law or third-party rights.
  </p>
  <p><strong>1.3 Reservation of rights.</strong> All rights not expressly granted to you herein are reserved by the Licensor.</p>

  <h2>2. Account & Access</h2>
  <p><strong>2.1 Registration.</strong> Certain features (QR storage, analytics, sync) require an account (via Firebase Auth with email or Apple ID). Anonymous mode is available with limitations.</p>
  <p><strong>2.2 Security.</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activities under your account.</p>
  <p><strong>2.3 Deletion.</strong> You can delete your account in the App settings. Deleting the account does not cancel an active subscription — manage it via Apple ID (Settings → Your name → Subscriptions).</p>

  <h2>3. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
  <p><strong>3.1 StoreKit purchases.</strong> Payments are processed by Apple (StoreKit). We do not store payment data; refunds are governed by Apple’s policies.</p>
  <p><strong>3.2 Auto-renewal.</strong> Subscriptions (e.g., Pro, Business, Ultra) renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. The next period’s charge occurs within the 24 hours prior to renewal.</p>
  <p><strong>3.3 Management.</strong> Manage or turn off auto-renewal in Apple ID settings. Actual price and availability depend on region and are shown by Apple on the purchase screen.</p>
  <p><strong>3.4 Trials.</strong> Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited upon purchase (where applicable).</p>
  <p><strong>3.5 Misuse.</strong> Sharing one account among multiple users to bypass paid plan limits is prohibited. Access may be suspended upon detection of suspicious activity with notice via email.</p>

  <h2>4. Content & IP</h2>
  <p><strong>4.1 Your content.</strong> You retain rights to content created using the App (QR codes, designs, links). You grant us a limited license to process such content solely to provide the Service (storage, delivery, rendering).</p>
  <p><strong>4.2 Licensor IP.</strong> The App (code, UI design, logos, materials) is the intellectual property of the Licensor and/or its partners.</p>

  <h2>5. Privacy & Data</h2>
  <p><strong>5.1 Privacy Policy.</strong> Data processing is governed by our Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p><strong>5.2 Analytics.</strong> QR analytics is available only with your explicit opt-in and within paid plans. Data is aggregated/de-identified; IP address may be used once to derive country/city and is not stored. We do not use IDFA nor perform tracking under Apple ATT.</p>
  <p><strong>5.3 Data transfers.</strong> Certain data (e.g., via Firebase) may be transferred outside your country (including the U.S.) under lawful mechanisms (SCC/DPF) as described in the Privacy Policy. Requests: <span class="mono">ixonity@gmail.com</span> (response within 30 days).</p>
  <p><strong>5.4 Portability.</strong> You may request a copy of your personal data in a commonly used, machine-readable format (subject to rights of others).</p>

  <h2>6. Acceptable Use & Moderation</h2>
  <p><strong>6.1 Purpose.</strong> The App is intended for lawful creation, customization, and distribution of QR codes.</p>
  <p><strong>6.2 Prohibited conduct.</strong> Illegal content, harm, abuse, or infringement of third-party rights (including hate speech) is prohibited.</p>
  <p><strong>6.3 Moderation.</strong> We may restrict access or remove content that violates this EULA or the law, with notice within 24 hours and a right to appeal within 14 days at <span class="mono">ixonity@gmail.com</span>.</p>

  <h2>7. Updates, Changes & Availability</h2>
  <p><strong>7.1 Updates.</strong> We may release mandatory/optional updates (features, fixes, UI changes).</p>
  <p><strong>7.2 Service changes.</strong> We may modify or discontinue certain features, providing a reasonable time to export data where applicable.</p>
  <p><strong>7.3 Dynamic QR.</strong> Dynamic QR codes remain active after subscription expiry; editing/analytics require renewal. Deleted codes cannot be restored.</p>

  <h2>8. Warranty & Liability</h2>
  <p><strong>8.1 “As is.”</strong> The App is provided “as is” without warranties, express or implied (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement).</p>
  <p><strong>8.2 Limitation of liability.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect/incidental/punitive/consequential damages, loss of data/profits/business interruption. Aggregate liability is limited to fees paid by you for paid features in the last 12 months, not exceeding the equivalent of 1000 UAH (unless mandatory law requires otherwise).</p>
  <p><strong>8.3 Backups.</strong> We recommend regular export (PNG/JSON). Restoration may be impossible in case of technical failures or account deletion.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p><strong>9.1 By either party.</strong> You may stop using the App at any time; we may suspend/terminate your license upon breach of this EULA.</p>
  <p><strong>9.2 Effect.</strong> Upon termination, you must cease using the App. Provisions relating to IP, liability, governing law, and disputes survive termination.</p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law & Disputes</h2>
  <p><strong>10.1 Law.</strong> This EULA is governed by consumer-protection and mandatory laws of your country of residence, and by the laws of Ukraine to the extent not inconsistent therewith. Primary jurisdiction of the Licensor is the courts of Odesa, Ukraine.</p>
  <p><strong>10.2 Consumer rights.</strong> Mandatory rules of your jurisdiction prevail where applicable.</p>
  <p><strong>10.3 Pre-trial resolution.</strong> Please contact <span class="mono">ixonity@gmail.com</span> first; we aim to respond within 14 business days.</p>

  <h2>11. Apple Requirements</h2>
  <p><strong>11.1 Parties.</strong> This Agreement is between you and the Licensor, not Apple.</p>
  <p><strong>11.2 Apple devices.</strong> The license is limited to Apple devices you own or control, in accordance with the App Store rules.</p>
  <p><strong>11.3 Support.</strong> Licensor provides App support.</p>
  <p><strong>11.4 Warranty/claims.</strong> If the App fails to conform to an applicable warranty, you may notify Apple; Apple will refund the purchase price (if applicable). Other obligations rest with the Licensor.</p>
  <p><strong>11.5 Third-party beneficiaries.</strong> Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this EULA and may enforce it upon your acceptance.</p>

  <h2>12. Activity Logging</h2>
  <p><strong>12.1 Audit.</strong> Certain actions (login, analytics opt-in, settings changes, data deletion) may be logged for audit/legal compliance. Logs are encrypted and used internally only.</p>

  <h2>13. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p><strong>13.1 Platforms.</strong> The Service depends on Google Firebase (auth, storage, analytics) and Apple StoreKit (payments). We are not liable for outages of such platforms; incident info may be communicated via our website or push/email.</p>

  <h2>14. Age</h2>
  <p><strong>14.1 Minimum age.</strong> The Service is for users aged 17+ (or age of consent in your jurisdiction). Parents/guardians are responsible for minors’ use. We may request age/consent verification (e.g., COPPA, GDPR Art. 8).</p>

  <h2>15. Force Majeure</h2>
  <p><strong>15.1 Events.</strong> We are not liable for failure/delay due to force-majeure events (natural disasters, war, strikes, cyberattacks, third-party platform outages). We will notify of material incidents within 72 hours and use reasonable efforts to restore functionality.</p>

  <h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>
  <p><strong>16.1 Entire Agreement.</strong> This EULA, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement regarding the App.</p>
  <p><strong>16.2 Severability.</strong> Invalidity of any provision shall not affect the remainder.</p>
  <p><strong>16.3 Language.</strong> In case of discrepancies between localized versions, the English version prevails unless mandatory law requires otherwise.</p>
